# Requirements
## Introduction
 A Scientific calculator is a device which can perform some mathematical operations like arthmetic operations
& scinetific operations i.e here In this project we are going to implement some calculator operations using
C Language with a Command Line Interface ( CLI ) where it can perform operations like :
 - Arthemetic Operations 
 - Scientific Operations 
 - Trignometric Operations

# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who:

- As a single developer, I Will be soley working on this project
- A normal user who requires calculator operations will be using this project
- Any user can use It, It is an open source.

## What:

- We can except the results that user can perform mathematical operations like arthimetic , Trigonometric & Scientific operations.

## When:

- The Project started on 6/04/2021
- The project will be delivered on 15/04/21

## Where:

- The Project will be carried out to any one it is a opensource.
- The Project will be used by users who requires matchematical operations.

## How:

- The Project is going to be implemented in C language for the Both Windows & Linux OS
- The constraints of the project are to develop using industry standards with a multi-file approach.
- The Timeline of the project is 10 days.
