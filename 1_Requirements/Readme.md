# Requirements
## Introduction
 A Scientific calculator is a device which can perform some mathematical operations like arthmetic operations
& scinetific operations i.e here In this project we are going to implement some calculator operations using
C Language with a Command Line Interface ( CLI ) where it can perform operations like :
 - Arthemetic Operations - Addition , Multiplication , Divison , Subtraction
 - Scientific Operations - Sin , Cos , Tan , Power , Squareroot
